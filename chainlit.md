# Welcome to SQL-CHAT 
# Assistant! 💁🏻

Hi there, Analyst! 👋 We're excited to have you on board. SQLCHAT is a powerful tool designed to help you quickly analyze relational data from a file or database.

Right now we have a few test tables loaded up. Feel free to ask the Assistant about the Database, Tables, and perform other analysis.

Soon we will let you upload or sync your own data and turn it into a Dashboard.
All just talking to the Assistant!
